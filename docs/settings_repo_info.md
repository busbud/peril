# Config JSON

**@see** - [Introducing Peril to the Artsy Org](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2017/09/04/Introducing-Peril/)

Let's deep dive into the JSON:

```json5
{
  "settings": {
    [your settings]
  },
  "rules": {
    "pull_request": "dangerfiles/pr.js",
    "issues": "orta/peril-settings@dangerfiles/issue.js"
  },
  "repos" : {
    "orta/ORStackView": {
      "issue.created": "lock_old_issues.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

It is parsed via JSON5, so you can add comments.

### `settings`

**@see** -
[api/source/db/GitHubRepoSettings.ts](https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/api/source/db/GitHubRepoSettings.ts)

I'm hesitant to add the specific settings which are supported inside this document, as it'll always end up out of date.

The source code above should be a reasonable read.

### `rules`

**@see** - [api/source/db/index.ts](https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/api/source/db/index.ts)

These are globally applied rules, e.g. to every repo. It's a set of `event names`, to `dangerfiles`.

#### Event Names

These are the names of a webhook from GitHub. A webhook event always has a name, but it may also have an action.

For example, when you set up Peril, you'll have received this webhook:

![](images/events-ex.png)

It has an event of `integration_installation` and an action of `created`. The keys in the rules section allow you to
write dangerfiles which only run against either a specific action, or against all of them.

You can get information about _any_ webhook
[action/names in the GitHub docs](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/).

For a Pull Request, there are
[a lot of actions](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent): It can be one of
`assigned`, `unassigned`, `review_requested`, `review_request_removed`, `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `opened`, `edited`,
`closed`, `reopened` or `synchronize`.

You can specify a Dangerfile to run either on **all** events by using `"pull_request"` or only a specific action on a
pull request with `"pull_request.[action]"`.

For example:

```json5
{
  rules: {
    pull_request: "...", // all events
    "pull_request.assigned": "...", // only on when a PR has someone assigned
    "pull_request.closed": "...", // only on when a PR is closed
    "pull_request.synchronize": "...", // only when the commits for a PR's branch have changed
    // ...
  },
}
```

You can have a combination of rules run which the same Dangerfile in order to get the behavior you want, for example to
replicate the exact process of running Danger on CI, you could use:

```json5
{
  rules: {
    "pull_request.opened": "artsy/peril-settings@org/all-prs.ts",
    "pull_request.synchronize": "artsy/peril-settings@org/all-prs.ts",
  },
}
```

Which would run `"org/pr.ts"` when a PR is created, and then updated.

#### Extra features

You can use commas to have a single run be triggered by many events and actions. So the above could be this instead:

```json5
{
  rules: {
    "pull_request.opened, pull_request.synchronize": "artsy/peril-settings@org/all-prs.ts",
  },
}
```

**Advanced:** You can use parens to dive into the webhook's json to only run in very specific edge cases. So, for
example if we have this webhook JSON:

```json
{
  "action": "opened",
  "issue": {
    "id": 226685977,
    "number": 2,
    "title": "Update the README to explain why there is TypeScript et al",
    "user": {
      "login": "orta",
      "type": "User",
      "site_admin": false
    },
    "labels": [],
    "state": "open",
    "assignee": {
      "login": "orta",
      "id": 49038
    },
    "milestone": null,
    "comments": 0,
    "created_at": "2017-05-05T20:40:02Z",
    "updated_at": "2017-05-05T20:40:02Z",
    "closed_at": null,
    "body": ""
  },
  "organization": {
    "login": "artsy",
    "id": 546231
  },
  "sender": {
    "login": "orta",
    "id": 49038,
    "type": "User",
    "site_admin": false
  },
  "installation": {
    "id": 23511
  }
}
```

You have _all sorts_ of potential bits of data to work with:

```json5
{
  rules: {
    "issue (sender.site_admin == true)": "org/welcome-admins.ts",
    "issue.closed (sender.type == Bot)": "org/post-peril-auto-close.ts",
    "issue.opened (issue.number == 1000)": "org/congrats-issue-one-thousand.ts",
  },
}
```

Bug: as this is all pretty much all hacky string manipulation, it doesn't really mix well with commas in the strings.
Happy to take PRs improving this if you want it :+1:.

### `dangerfiles`

The value in these keys is a reference to a Dangerfile. There are two ways of specifying a Dangerfile, remote or local.

- Remote references are Dangerfiles that do not live on the repo from which the event came.
- Local references come from the same repo as the event.

For Dangerfiles which run on many repos, you probably want to use a remote reference. It would look something like:

- `repo/slug@path/to/dangerfile.js` - _in abstract_
- `artsy/peril-settings@org/closed-prs.ts`- _in concrete_

For a Dangerfile which exists on the repo your running events from, you can use a local reference

- `path/to/dangerfile.js`

You can also append `#branch` to the end of a string to select a branch to run from.

I'd like to add a way to indicate nullability being OK at some point, e.g. `path/to/dangerfile.js?` - however for now
you will get an error message if the dangerfile does not exist.

### `repos`

Rules are for every repo, `repos` are rules for a single repo.

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "pull_request": "artsy/peril-settings@org/all-prs.ts",
    "pull_request.closed": "org/closed-prs.ts"
  },
  "repos": {
    "artsy/reaction": {
      "pull_request": "danger/pr.ts"
    },
    "artsy/positron": {
      "pull_request": ["dangerfile.ts", "check-for-assignee.ts"]
    }
  },
```

So, let's say a PR is closed on `artsy/reaction`, it would trigger three Dangerfiles to run:

- `"artsy/peril-settings@org/all-prs.ts"`
- `"org/closed-prs.ts"` - _this comes from whatever repo hosts the settings JSON_
- `"danger/pr.ts"` - _this comes from artsy/reaction_

If a PR were `edited` or `opened`, it would trigger two dangerfiles:

- `"artsy/peril-settings@org/all-prs.ts"`
- `"danger/pr.ts"` - _this comes from artsy/reaction_

I'm not sure the order in which they're ran, so don't rely on that. You can also use an array to execute a set of
dangerfiles instead of making a single mega-file.

# Writing a Dangerfile

You can write your Dangerfiles in JavaScript or TypeScript. It will be transpiled with these settings:

- [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/runner/tsconfig.json)
- [.babelrc](https://github.com/danger/peril/blob/master/runner/.babelrc)

These are not set in stone. You're welcome to improve them.

### PR vs Event

There are two types of Dangerfile runs.

- _PR_ runs, which are related to PR events. This is the normal DSL in the
  [Danger JS Reference](http://danger.systems/js/reference.html)
- _Event_ runs, which are anything other than PR events. In these cases the `github` instance in the DSL is replaced
  with the JSON that came in from the event.

Not all events have something they can comment on, only `pull_request` and `issues`. So `fail`, `warn`, `markdown` and
`message` won't work. In practice we've used a slack webhook to pass information back to our dev channel. It's just
JavaScript, so you can use any module you want.

### Tasks

If you have Peril hooked up to a Mongo DB instance (via the ENV var `MONGODB_URI` (there's a free heroku add-on which
works with no config)) then you can schedule jobs to run in the future. An example of this is in the Artsy peril, where
creating an RFC issue will send notifications for a few days into our slack.

This works by defining tasks in your `peril.settings.json`:

```json
{
  "tasks": {
    "message-slack-dev-channel": "tasks/slackDevChannel.ts",
    "daily-license-check": "tasks/dailyLicenseCheck.ts",
    "standup": ["tasks/checkForOpenRFCs.ts", "tasks/checkForNewRepos.ts"]
  }
}
```

Which maps a task name to a file in a repo. You schedule tasks either by using the Peril object inside a Dangerfile:

```ts
import { danger, peril } from "danger"
import { Issues } from "github-webhook-event-types"

const slackify = (text: string) => ({
  // generates a API slack compatible object, which is passed into the task
  // as the first arg of a default param later on.
})

export default async (webhook: Issues) => {
  const issue = webhook.issue
  if (issue.title.includes("RFC:") || issue.title.includes("[RFC]")) {
    await peril.runTask("message-slack-dev-channel", "in 5 minutes", slackify("ðŸŽ‰: A new RFC has been published."))
    await peril.runTask("message-slack-dev-channel", "in 3 days", slackify("ðŸ•°: A new RFC was published 3 days ago."))
    await peril.runTask("message-slack-dev-channel", "in 7 days", slackify("ðŸ•°: A new RFC is ready to be resolved."))
  }
}
```

This schedules three jobs using [agenda](https://github.com/agenda/agenda) under the hood. The params are a task name, a
strings based on [human-interval](https://github.com/agenda/human-interval), then data which will be passed through to
your job later.

Or you can schedule tasks via the peril settings scheduler below.

When your task starts running, you can access data provided via the dangerfile API via the first param in the default
export:

```ts
import { peril } from "danger"
import { IncomingWebhook } from "@slack/client"

export default (data: any) => {
  const url = peril.env.SLACK_RFC_WEBHOOK_URL || ""
  const webhook = new IncomingWebhook(url)
  webhook.send(data)
}
```

### Scheduler

Scheduled tasks to run using a human readable syntax. This runs from a set of standard hooks which will trigger running
a task. The current hooks (may be out of date, see `InstallationSchedulerKeys` in the codebase) are `"hourly"`,
`"daily"`, `"weekly"`, `"monday-morning-est"`, `"tuesday-morning-est"`, `"wednesday-morning-est"`,
`"thursday-morning-est"`, `"friday-morning-est"`.

```json
{
  "scheduler": {
    "daily": "daily-license-check",
    "weekly": "cleanup-stale-issues"
  }
}
```

### Types

If you're writing in TypeScript, I have [a node module](https://github.com/orta/github-webhook-event-types) that just
contains the types of all the events. This is really useful in an event run.

For example, this is a Dangerfile for an issue event:

```ts
import { schedule, danger } from "danger"
import { IncomingWebhook } from "@slack/client"
import { Issues } from "github-webhook-event-types"

export default async (webhook: Issues) => {
  const issue = webhook.issue

  if (issue.title.includes("RFC:")) {
    var url = peril.env.SLACK_RFC_WEBHOOK_URL || ""
    var webhook = new IncomingWebhook(url)
    schedule(async () => {
      await webhook.send({
        unfurl_links: false,
        attachments: [
          {
            pretext: "ðŸŽ‰ A new Peril RFC has been published.",
            color: "good",
            title: issue.title,
            title_link: issue.html_url,
            author_name: issue.user.login,
            author_icon: issue.user.avatar_url,
          },
        ],
      })
    })
  }
}
```

### Known limitations for the Heroku version

- You cannot do a relative import of a JS/TS file in the same repo
- Async work needs to be `schedule`'d - rather than relying on the node process to handle all async work

Neither of these are issues when working with the main prod/staging Peril.

# Importing other files

For Peril prod/staging you have access to all of the dependencies used in Peril. I'm pretty chill
about expanding those dependencies, so long as they feel on topic to Danger - no using my VMs for mining please

You can import and access any of those dependencies like normal. The one weird edge case is with relative imports inside
your repos. Instead of writing a Dangerfile like this:

```ts
import { openFile } from "./open"
export default () => {
  openFile("name.thing")
}
```

You need to use `async import` to import from another file:

```ts
export default async () => {
  const {openFile} = async import("./open")
  openFile("name.thing")
}
```

This is because Peril will need to use the GitHub API to grab the contents of that file, rather than relying on
synchronous filesystem access like normal. TypeScript will have no problem with this, the type system at dev time will
basically treat it the same.

# Writing Tests for your Dangerfile

Because the default function will be evaluated, you can set up individual rules as named exports, then have the default
export run them all. This makes testing a Dangerfile no different than testing any other JavaScript file.

You can mock `danger` as an import and use any sort of mocked data you want.

```js
jest.mock("danger", () => jest.fn())
import * as danger from "danger"
const dm = danger as any

import { rfc5 } from "../org/all-prs"

beforeEach(() => {
  dm.fail = jest.fn()
})

it("fails when there's no PR body", async () => {
  dm.danger = { github: { pr: { body: "" } } }
  await rfc5()
  expect(dm.fail).toHaveBeenCalledWith("Please add a description to your PR.")
})

it("does nothing when there's a PR body", async () => {
  dm.danger = { github: { pr: { body: "Hello world" } } }
  return rfc5()
  expect(dm.fail).not.toHaveBeenCalled()
})
```

There are extensive tests on the [Artsy Peril Settings repo](https://github.com/artsy/peril-settings/tree/master/tests)
